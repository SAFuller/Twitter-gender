Data during the debate streamed using the search query terms:
      {"Joe Biden", "Cory Booker", "Pete Buttigieg", "Julián Castro", "Kamala Harris", 
     "Amy Klobuchar","Beto O’Rourke","Bernie Sanders", "Elizabeth Warren","Andrew Yang",
     "Biden", "Booker", "Buttigieg", "Castro", "Harris", "Klobuchar", "O'Rourke", "Sanders", "Warren", "Yang",
     "@SenSanders","@ewarren", "@BetoORourke","@AndrewYang", "@JulianCastro",
     "@CoryBooker", "@SenKamalaHarris", "@amyklobuchar", "@JoeBiden", "@PeteButtigieg" ,"@kamalaHarris",
     "@BernieSanders","@SenWarren",
     "Joe", "Cory", "Pete", "Julián", "Julian", "Kamala", "Amy", "Beto", "Bernie", "Elizabeth", "Andrew"}
     
  -Query terms different because we can be more confident that use of either first or last names more likely to be acout the candidate. (ex someone talking about "Joe" during the debate is probably talking about Joe Biden, not during the debate, its less likely.)

Data after debate collected on 9/19/2020 using same specifications aspre debate.
